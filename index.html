            My Experience
        </strong>

        <p id="FirstText">
        I’ve been working with <strong>Lua</strong> for over <strong>2 years</strong>, creating and contributing to multiple Roblox games including ones with millions of visits. 
        I specialize in scripting combat systems, flight mechanics, and animation controls inside Roblox Studio.
      </p>

       <p id="SecondText">
        I also have experience in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> for a few months, building websites like this portfolio to improve my front-end skills.

      </p>


        <p id="ThirdText">
        In addition, I’ve been animating for <strong>4 years</strong>, working with Sticknodes, Blender, and Roblox Studio. 
        I also edit videos for personal projects and school activities, though I’m currently <strong>not accepting percentage as a payment option</strong>.

        I had worked with alot of teams when i was working in roblox studio and was able to develop around 12 to 15 games.
        I am currently selling some of the stuff that i made which will be listed in the works section.
        My payment options are <strong>Paypal, Gcash, and PSN giftcards only.</strong>
